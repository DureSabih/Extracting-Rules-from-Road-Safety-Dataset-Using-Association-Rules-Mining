DATSET:
Data was gathered by Department from Transport and include details of injuries and road collisions in Great Britain for the 
year 2013. Data is in .txt file and includes 8 features and 47790 instances recorded by Traffic police 
in response to violations or collisions. This tells us that within the UK in the year 2013 there were 
47790 instances of violations or collisions. The purpose of this research is to use datamining and 
machine learning to identify what is the major reason for these traffic violations, subsequently to find 
out the reasonâ€™s association or correlation with other factors involved at the time of event, such as 
gender, time, weather, month, intoxication. Research aims at finding meaningful rules that would help 
understand road traffic behaviour.
